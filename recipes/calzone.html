        <h1>Italian Calzone</h1>
        <img src="../images/calzone.jpg" height="200" width="200">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These calzones are the real deal because there is no tomato 
            sauce inside! 
            We eat them at least once a week. 
            Have a bowl of tomato or spaghetti 
            sauce on the table for people to top their calzone if desired.

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese.</li>
                <li>1/2 cup riotta cheese.</li>
                <li>1/2 cup diced pepperoni.</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms.</li>

            </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl;
                     let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil,
                      sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth.
                       Gradually stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.
                </li>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until it is elastic,
                     about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl;
                      lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil.
                       Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes. 
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese, pepperoni,
                     mushrooms, and basil leaves in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate to chill. 
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Punch down dough; divide into 2 equal pieces.
                     Roll each piece out on a lightly floured surface into 1/8-inch-thick circles. 
                     Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese and meat filling.
                </li>
            </ol>
